# Modify this to point to where your Robot tests live.  A /results directory will also be written to this directory with logs, results and screenshots.
# Note: You do *not* have to rebuild since this script is run from local machine!

# Example: TEST_PATH='/home/user/tests'
# This default will use the example /test directory in this repo
TEST_PATH=$(pwd)

# If you want time stamped output result files add:  --timestampoutputs 
# Default behavior is to overwrite the results each test
